# Modelling Gravitational Systems

This repository contains assignments and projects from a bootcamp on **Modelling Gravitational Systems**. The course applies Python libraries and numerical methods to model and simulate gravitational systems.

## Week 1: Python Basics
In [**Week 1**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IeabwE4GRLb6fROT_Ep9u2bdTcn0DuJ-), the focus was on foundational Python libraries:
- [**NumPy**](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/index.html): Array manipulation for scientific computing.
- [**TensorFlow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide): Basic introduction to machine learning.
- [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/): Data manipulation using DataFrames.
- [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html): Visualization and plotting.

## Week 2: Two-Body Problem Simulation
In [**Week 2**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13xyovUaihRNz0ztnjf-BHhB3osp01NQT?usp=sharing), we applied the libraries learned in Week 1 to simulate the **Two-Body Problem**:
- **Simulation**: Modeling the motion of two bodies in 3D space.
- **Energy Analysis**: Plotting potential and kinetic energy as a function of time.

## Week 3: N-Body Problem Simulation
In [**Week 3**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Jr0x500B3RNCAOCdH7tGtMfC4zDJbVW_?usp=sharing), we generalised the previous code to work for any number of bodies:
- **Restricted 3 body problem**: Studying the restricted version of the 3 body problem, simulating it and plotting contours of the potential field.
- **Experimentation**: Plotting Earth, Moon, Sun system, 8 figure orbit, and some random initial conditions.


## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - To clone this repository to your local machine, run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/tejask-42/Modelling-Gravitational-Systems.git
     ```

2. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Navigate to the appropriate week folder (e.g., `Week_1` or `Week_2`).
   - Open the `.ipynb` files using a Jupyter Notebook environment or Google Colab:
     - For Jupyter Notebook, run:
       ```bash
       jupyter notebook
       ```
     - Or, upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
